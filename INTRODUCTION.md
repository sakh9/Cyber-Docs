In today’s modern technological era, data has become one of the most valuable assets in the world. At the same time, it can also be one of the most destructive elements when misused. Sensitive information, digital systems, and network infrastructures are constantly exposed to risks that can cause serious damage to individuals, organizations, and even entire countries.

Many programs and network technologies can be exploited as tools to disrupt, manipulate, or completely immobilize targeted systems. These attacks may be directed at individuals, groups, companies, or critical infrastructures. Cybercriminals often carry out such actions to gain financial profit, steal confidential information, sabotage operations, or achieve other malicious objectives.

As technology continues to evolve, the number and complexity of cyber threats also increase. This situation makes digital environments more vulnerable to attacks such as data breaches, malware infections, phishing, ransomware, and unauthorized system access. Without proper protection, these threats can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and operational failures.

Therefore, cybersecurity emerges as a crucial field focused on protecting systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. It involves the implementation of security policies, technologies, and best practices to prevent attacks, detect vulnerabilities, and respond effectively to incidents. Cybersecurity plays a vital role in ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, allowing digital systems to operate safely and reliably in an increasingly connected world.
